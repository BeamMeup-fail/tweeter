## How To Use Tweeter

#### Read Tweets

Depending on what device you're on, the tweet timeline will either be under your profile picture, or to the right.

The tweets will show new to old. Scroll through and enjoy.

Either click 'write a new tweet' on the navigation bar, or (if you scrolled down) click the orange arrow on the right bottom.

This will open the tweet field. Simply write your thoughts and click tweet. You will see it appear on the timeline.
